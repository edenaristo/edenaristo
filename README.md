## Hi, I'm Eden ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I am a final-year CS student at the University of Melbourne. Combining my CS skills, I also have a strong passion for finance, especially in the field of machine learning, quantitative trading, and data-driven investments. In addition, I gained extensive leadership experience while managing large-scale projects within a large organisation. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects in the tech and finance sectors, or both!
